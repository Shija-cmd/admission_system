# admission_system 
The admission system is the machine learning system that predicts whether or not the postgraduate applicant can qualify to join the postgraduate course. The criteria used are TOEFL,
Research experience, Undergraduate GPA, High school points, Letter of Recommendation and Statement of Purpose. The project included training models and integrating the model 
with the API, with the help of the django framework. The language used to create the API is Python. 
# Technologies used for developing the system
* Machine Learning for data training
* Django for the backend
* Bootstrap for the UI in which
  * Javascript
  * CSS
  * HTML were used
* Dataset was obtained from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions
# Machine learning algorithms:
* Data Source:
* Data sources included data from Kaggle. However, some data were collected from the National Examination Council of Tanzania(NECTA) and some undergraduate GPAs according to       Tanzania Universities and featured with the data from Kaggle.
* Data Cleaning:
  The feature which was removed from the data is the Graduate Record Examination which is not applicable in most Universities in Tanzania.
* Data Analysis
  Data were analysed to observe the trend of admission criteria of the postgraduate students, for example the correlation coefficient is a statistical measure of the strength of a linear relationship between two or more variables. Its values can range from -1 to correlation coefficient of -1 describes a perfect negative, or inverse, correlation, with values in one series rising as those in the other decline, and the opposite. The correlation coefficients of the dataset are illustrated in Figure below

* Performace of the models:
  The algorithms used in developing the models are 
  Random Forest, 
  Logistic Regression, 
  Decision Tree, 
  Support Vector Machine (SVM), 
  Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB) and 
  K Nearest Neighbours (KNN).
* Performance of the models:
  ** Random Forest classification: The Random Forest Classification scored 0.938 and the confusion matrices are shown in Figures below.

  ** K Nearest Neighboures (KNN): 
The metrics of the KNN included accuracy which was 0.925. This accuracy was compared to various accuracies according to different values of K (As shown in the figure below).

# Web based Application Development:
The system was developed with the aid of Python programming language. The figure below shows some of the important interfaces developed for data input and output from the system.

# Conclusion
Generally, this project was a useful experience; I gained new skills, knowledge, and professional exposure to how to solve social problems from my expertise and met with experienced expert personnel for solving social problems, especially in shortlisting postgraduate students. 
Related to the study I learned more about how to develop a model from machine learning knowledge. This project program gave me insights and motivation to pursue a career in machine learning knowledge and skills.
# Recommendation
Institutions and universities have a real-time system for shortlisting students suitable for courses with minor errors but for the computation of large data by machine learning techniques.
